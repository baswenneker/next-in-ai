# Write a newsletter in 5 minutes with GPT
Hi, my name is Bas and I'm the author of the Dutch AI newsletter [Next in AI](https://nextinai.beehiiv.com/). I've written this Python script to automate 80% of the process of writing a newsletter. It's not perfect, but it saves me a lot of time. I hope it can help you too.
